Craft: Ambiguity vs. [Precision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n5SqwERoOc)?

- Ship; No iterations with Precision
- Deploy; Perhaps it comes from Encoding history
- Telecommute; Of the genre of the very best?
- `Fast-Iterate-Speed`; Yes, because...
- Progress; My Fave Womens Jam says so!
- But my [Welch Center Research Pearls](https://jhustata.github.io/intermediate/quickrefs.html#welch-center-research-pearl) fiasco:
   - Should've kept to simple idea of do `${repo}welchcenter.do`
   - In a word: remote directory workflow
   - But the temptation to talk version control, seamless collaboration, and transparency?
   - Muddied my thoughts, presentation, and attempts to pack my "5min of fame"
   - Let's remain lucid, simple, precise, elemental

                                       1. Costs
